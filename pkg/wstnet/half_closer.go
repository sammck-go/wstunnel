// ReadHalfCloser is an interface for bidirectional io streams that implement CloseRead()
//
// CloseRead shuts down the reading half of a bidirectional io stream (e.g., "socket").
// Corresponds to net.TCPConn.CloseRead(). This method is called by the reader to
// indicate no further reads will be coming after this call. The remote writer, if
// any, will receive an error on further attempts to write to the stream. However, the
// write half of the bidirectional stream remains active. This method has few practical
// uses (unlike CloseWrite), but is included here for completeness.

// WriteHalfCloser is an interface for bidirectional io streams that implement CloseWrite()

// Corresponds to net.TCPConn.CloseWrite(). This method is called by the writer to
// indicate end-of-stream; no further writes are possible after this call. However, the
// read half of the bidirectional stream remains active. It allows for protocols
// like HTTP 1.0 in which a client sends a request, closes the write side of the socket,
// then reads the response, and a server reads a request until end-of-stream before
// sending a response.
